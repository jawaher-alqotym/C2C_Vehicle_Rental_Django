A platform to facilitate renting cars for both vehicle owners and vehicle rentee. The system will help users find a vehicle to rent directly from the vehicle owner without a “middle-man” and allow anyone with a vehicle to further benefit from it and generate an additional income by putting it up for rent.

## Inspiration:

- <b>Facilitate the renting process.</b>
- <b>Reducing vehicle renting costs. </b>
- <b>Help vehicle owners generate additional income by putting their cars for rent.</b>

## C2C Vehicle Reantl Impact and challenges:
The project helps reduce vehicle renting costs and gas costs for users(the person who rents the vehicle will pay for the gas). Although the idea is promising it has some weaknesses like authenticating the vehicle owner and vehicle rentee. Not many people would be happy to see strangers drive their vehicle without being sure of their identity and people are reluctant to pay without a guarantee of the existence of that vehicle. However, we can get around these weaknesses by requiring both parties to register an account to establish some credentials and provide a personal page for both with reviews.

## List of Services / Features:
- Manage renting vehicle.
- Manage offering vehicle for rent process.
